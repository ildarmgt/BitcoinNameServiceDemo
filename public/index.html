    content="On-chain DNS where easy to read domain name (i.e. alias) can be looked up or shared to forward to many very long alphanumeric Bitcoin addresses or other types of addreses (e.g. ipfs, https, twitter) on the most secure public network ever created. 1 domain name on BNS can provide many forwarding addresses for any network. This is built as an embedded decentralized application (dapp) on the Bitcoin blockchain utilizing multiple building blocks including smart contracts and a trust minimized approach." />

      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.
